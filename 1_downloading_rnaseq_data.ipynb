This dataset includes [transcriptomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome) data that were collected during the NASA [Rodent Research 1 mission (RR1)](https://nlsp.nasa.gov/view/lsdapub/lsda_experiment/7633383e-fe88-5ada-92dd-cd31a50fda32).\n",

        "The OSD-104 study was part of a [SpaceX-4 mission](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/missions/SpaceX-4) that started on September 21, 2014 and ended October 25, 2014. There were several biological payloads on this mission, including rodents, fruit flies, plants, and yeast.

We provide a Python method which reduces the number of records in the FASTQ files by a configurable factor. Removing good records from a FASTQ file is not something one would normally do, but we are doing it in these labs so that you can go through all the steps to see how it is done and, at the same time, stay under the 15GB storage limit.\n",

The RNA sequence itself is in the second line and contains ASCII characters including A, C, G, T, and N - where N is a nucleotide which could not be identified. You can read more about N's in FASTQ files in [this FAQ](https://dnatech.ucdavis.edu/faqs/my-fastq-file-contains-ns-is-there-a-problem-with-my-data). The fourth line is a quality score, and there is one ASCII character representing the quality per nucleotide, where quality represents the probability that the base was erroneously called. Lower quality scores are better than higher ones.\n",
